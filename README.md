# WiSARD
The WiSARD model, originally created by I. Alexander [1], is a Weightless Neural Network that uses RAM-based (and by "RAM", it is meant "Random Access Memory") discriminators to classify patterns. For more information, some available resources (articles) that can be recommended are [2] and [3] (they also briefly describe other weightless models). 

The code present in this repository is just a **TEST** implementation of the WiSARD classifier in Python and might be useful only for educational purposes (the code is very "crude"). For those wanting a mature implementation, it is suggested the [PyWANN](https://github.com/firmino/PyWANN) library (developed for Python 2).

## Additional Information
This software was developed using Python 3.5 and should be compatible with Python 3 subversions.
